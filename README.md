###### Understanding volumetricc convolutions thru python code

The code in intended to demistifies volumentric convolutions, a core operation for today's neural nets, 
where we have a 3D volume for the input (a spatial plance times the feature map) and 
a 3D volume for the output (similarly, a spatial plance times the feature map)

The ideas are lucidly explained [here](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/); 
the code implements the ideas in a way they can be grasped by beginners.

To be sure, several optimizations are possible, but they get in the way of comprehension.

Two results can be verified from the two screen captures below

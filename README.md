##### Understanding Volumetric Convolutions with Python Code

The code in intended to demystify volumentric convolutions, a core operation for today's neural nets, 
where we have a 3D volume for the input (a spatial plane times the feature map) and 
a 3D volume for the output (similarly, a spatial plane times the feature map)

The ideas are lucidly explained [here](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#conv); 
the code implements volumetric such that they can be grasped by beginners.

To be sure, several performance optimizations are possible, but they get in the way of comprehension.

Two results can be verified from the two screen captures below.
